Tender System
Does each department within your organization follow a strict procurement process every time products and services need to be purchased?
Or are contracts and projects for goods and services simply awarded to just any supplier based on gut feeling?
When it comes to purchasing something for the organization, are there any rules to govern the entire purchasing flow within your company such as:
•	Which suppliers to request a quotation from?
•	Request for quotations (RFQ) are requested from how many suppliers?
•	What criterias are contracts awarded based on?
It is important for all organizations to have a procurement process in place so that:
•	Products and services can be obtained at the best possible price.
•	The administrative cost for procurement is low and predictable.
•	Award of contracts based on direct negotiations can be eliminated if possible.
•	There is transparency when it comes to how projects and contracts are awarded.
If your organization does not have a strategic sourcing procurement process in place, then it’s good to begin creating one now.
If there is already one, then you can try to automate the processes to the next level by utilizing software applications which streamlines the procurement workflow and processes.
